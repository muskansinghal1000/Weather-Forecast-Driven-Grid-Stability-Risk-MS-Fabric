# Weather-Forecast-Driven-Grid-Stability-Risk-MS-Fabric
Predictive Grid Stability Risk Using Weather Forecasts in Microsoft Fabric

**Overview**:\
This project leverages Microsoft Fabric to analyze and predict grid stability risks based on weather forecasts. By integrating multi-location weather data and correlating it with grid performance metrics, the solution enables proactive risk mitigation and smarter energy planning.

üß† **Objectives**

* Integrate weather data - Real-time ingestion from APIs across multiple locations
* Map anomalies to grid stress - Correlate weather events with grid performance metrics 
* Predict risk zones - Use ML models to forecast grid stress levels 
* Visualize in Power BI - Dashboards with alerts and KPI thresholds 
* Enable cross-workspace sharing - Fabric shortcuts and governance scripts 
* Document architecture - Diagrams and validation checklists

üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Stack**
* Microsoft Fabric: Lakehouse, Pipelines, Shortcuts, Notebooks, Pipeline, KQL Database
* Spark SQL & Python: Data transformation and modeling using Pandas,DataFrame
* Power BI: Dashboard design and alert logic
